## Introduction

In [WellSpring](https://wellspring-pconde705.herokuapp.com) users can sign up for an account, which allows them to create and back any project of their choice. To back a project they can either type in an amount of their choice or they can choose a fixed amount pledge that comes with a reward that the project creator has specified.

Features:

* View project feed
* Navigate feed based on the project category
* View a project individually
* Monitor the progress of each project as it attempts to reach its funding goals
* Create projects
* Create rewards for those projects
* Back a project through a reward or amount of your choice
* See live stats of projects that become funded
* Search for any existing project

## Project Creation

To create a project simply click on the button in the navbar that will always be available allowing for ease of access. Upon completion of each input field the form will redirect you to your project page that you just created. Everything you need to start a project is on that one page further emphasizing ease of usability. The description input field can be made bigger by a simple click-and-drag action.

## Project Rewards

Rewards are not necessary to create a project. They are meant to gift a community of passionate followers that would love to see your idea come to fruition. The design was similar to how you create a project so as to not confuse users. A slightly different color scheme and background is used for minimal differentiation between it and the project form.

## Project Show

</p>

In the display page you can read a detailed description the project creator has written about the project, and what kind of rewards he/she has provided for that specific pledge amount. Here you will also discover live stats that chronicles the number of backers this project has, the number of backers each reward has, and how close the project is to reach its goal.

## Search

A simple search feature on the navbar provides ease of access and simplicity in use. It queries the backend searching for project titles, limiting the responses to five. This way it avoids clutter and encourages the user to be specific. Since search exists on the navbar it can be used anywhere in the app.

## Categories

<p align="center">

The category bar provides immediate filtering functionality that sends a request to the server and fetches from the database all the projects that matches the category being clicked on.

Live statistics showcase the current date, how many ongoing projects currently exist, how many backers WellSpring has, and how many projects have been successfully funded.

The stats page was the final thing added to the app that took the most time and effort. Not all aspects were challenging, but when it came to calculating the projects that had been funded, using the columns created in my table, required ruby methods performing calculations on the backend and a triple Full Outer Join written as a SQL query in Active Record.

```ruby
  def total_amount_raised
    first_value = project_backers.where('cash_only != 0').sum(:cash_only)
    second_value = reward_backers.sum(:amount)
    first_value + second_value
  end

  def total_number_of_backers
    user_backers.uniq.count
  end

  def self.all_projects
    Project.all.count
  end

  def self.all_funded_projects
    result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(<<-SQL)
      SELECT
        projects.id
      FROM
        projects
      FULL OUTER JOIN project_backers AS reward_backers ON reward_backers.project_id = projects.id
      FULL OUTER JOIN rewards ON reward_backers.reward_id = rewards.id
      FULL OUTER JOIN project_backers AS cash_backers ON cash_backers.project_id = projects.id
      GROUP BY
        projects.id
      HAVING
        sum(cash_backers.cash_only + rewards.amount) > projects.goal
    SQL
    result.count
  end
```

In order to correctly calculate whether the total amount had exceeded the initial goal the user had stated for that project, required a table keeping track of three things.

The data from the rewards table that kept track of the amounts each specific reward offered, the data from the project_backers table that kept track of any freely inputed cash amount to be donated, and the total_amount_raised (see method above) that calculates how much each specific project had already raised based on the two previous data inputs.

The total_amount_raised was thus a necessary creation that overwrote the initial money_raised column that existed in the projects table.
