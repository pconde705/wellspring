To create a project simply click on the button in the navbar that will always be available guaranteeing ease of creation. The form itself does not redirect or continue elsewhere. Everything you need to start a project is on one page further emphasizing ease of navigation. The description input field can be made bigger by a simple click-and-drag action.

Rewards are not necessary to create a project. They are meant to grow a community of passionate followers that would love to see your app come to fruition. The design was similar so as to not scare away users, but with a slightly different color scheme to showcase difference.
